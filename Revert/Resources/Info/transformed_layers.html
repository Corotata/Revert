<p>A selection of transformed layers with subviews showing both the transformed and identity (non-transformed) positions:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Y Rotate: A layer that has been rotated 15째 on the Y axis.</li>
	<li>X Rotate: A layer that has been rotated 15째 on the X axis.</li>
	<li>Z Rotate: A layer that has been rotated 15째 on the Z axis.</li>
	<li>XY Rotate: A layer that has been rotated 15째 on both the X and Y axes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The behaviour when mixing constraints and transforms has changed between iOS7 and iOS8. For more information please see <a href="http://revealapp.com/blog/constraints-and-transforms.html">our blog post</a>.</p>
