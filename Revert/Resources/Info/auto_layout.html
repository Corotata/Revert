<p>A scenario demoing the following Auto Layout attributes:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Leading / Trailing space: Both white views have their leading / trailing edge pinned to a common superview.</li>
  <li>Horizontal spacing: Both white views are separated by a fixed horizontal constraint.</li>
  <li>Align Centre X / Y: Both inner blue views are centered within their respective superviews.</li>
  <li>Ratio: Blue views width and height are constrained a ratio of 1:1.</li>
  <li>Proportional constraints: The blue views&#39; heights are constrained to be half of the their white container&#39;s height.</li>
  <li>Equals: Both white views are constrained to have equal widths and heights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try updating the constant value of the horizontal constraint separating both white <code>UIViews</code> and see the changes being reflected in <em>Reveal</em> and on your device or simulator.</p>
