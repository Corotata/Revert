<p>A selection of transformed views with embedded subviews showing both the transformed and identity (non-transformed) positions:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Translate: A view that has been translated (-20, 20).</li>
	<li>Rotate: A view that has been rotated 15Â°.</li>
	<li>Scale: A view that has been scaled by 50%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The behaviour when mixing constraints and transforms has changed between iOS7 and iOS8. For more information please see <a href="http://revealapp.com/blog/constraints-and-transforms.html">our blog post</a>.</p>
