<p>Demonstrates the following Auto Layout alignment scenarios:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Leading / Trailing alignment: Both blue views have their leading / trailing edges aligned to the orange view’s leading / trailing edges.</li>
	<li>Top / Bottom alignment: Green views have their top and bottom edges aligned to the grey view’s top and bottom edges.</li>
	<li>Baseline / Vertical / Horizontal alignment: Labels are baseline / vertically / horizontally aligned with their counterparts.</li>
	<li>Alignment Rects: White, semi-transparent views are constrained to the alignment rect of the central red view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try updating the constant value of the orange view&#39;s width constraint and see the changes being reflected in <em>Reveal</em> and on your device or simulator.</p>
