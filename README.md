# REVEal Rendering Test

Revert is a sample iOS application destined to be inspected with @revealapp. It showcases UIKit's stock views and controls as well as specific view scenarios. It is an Universal app running on iOS7+ devices which supports portrait and lanscape orientation. It also support iOS dynamic type setting.

## Getting Started

Run the following steps to start inspecting _Revert_ with _Reveal_:

- Download and clone the repository: _git clone https://github.com/revealapp/revert.git_
- Open Revert: _open revert/Revert.xcodeproj_
- Run the project: _âŒ˜+ R_
- Launch _Reveal_ and start inspecting

## Changes between iOS Versions

The behaviour when mixing constraint and transform has evolved between iOS7 and iOS8. Hence, the view controllers dealing with transforms (`TransformViewsViewController`, `TransformLayersViewController`, `AnchorPointBoundsChangeViewController`) will behave differently if running the application on an iOS7 or an iOS8 device. For more information please see [this blog post](http://revealapp.com/blog/constraints-and-transforms.html).
